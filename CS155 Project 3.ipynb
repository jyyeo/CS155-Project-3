profit thee, and much enrich thy book.', '  but thou art all my art, and dost advance', '  as high as learning, my rude ignorance.', '  then thank him not for that which he doth say,', '  since what he owes thee, thou thy self dost pay.', '  then if he thrive and i be cast away,', '  the worst was this, my love was my decay.', '  you still shall live (such virtue hath my pen)', '  where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.', '  and their gross painting might be better used,', '  where cheeks need blood, in thee it is abused.', '  there lives more life in one of your fair eyes,', '  than both your poets can in praise devise.', '  you to your beauteous blessings add a curse,', '  being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.', '  then others, for the breath of words respect,', '  me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.', '  but when your countenance filled up his line,', '  then lacked i matter, that enfeebled mine.', '  thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter,', '  in sleep a king, but waking no such matter.', '  such is my love, to thee i so belong,', '  that for thy right, my self will bear all wrong.', \"  for thee, against my self i'll vow debate,\", \"  for i must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.\", '  and other strains of woe, which now seem woe,', '  compared with loss of thee, will not seem so.', '  wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take,', '  all this away, and me most wretched make.', \"  but what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?\", '  thou mayst be false, and yet i know it not.', \"  how like eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,\", '  if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show.', '  for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,', '  lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.', '  take heed (dear heart) of this large privilege,', '  the hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.', '  but do not so, i love thee in such sort,', '  as thou being mine, mine is thy good report.', \"  or if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,\", \"  that leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.\", '  yet seemed it winter still, and you away,', '  as with your shadow i with these did play.', '  more flowers i noted, yet i none could see,', \"  but sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee.\", '  give my love fame faster than time wastes life,', \"  so thou prevent'st his scythe, and crooked knife.\", '  then do thy office muse, i teach thee how,', '  to make him seem long hence, as he shows now.', '  therefore like her, i sometime hold my tongue:', '  because i would not dull you with my song.', '  and more, much more than in my verse can sit,', '  your own glass shows you, when you look in it.', '  for fear of which, hear this thou age unbred,', \"  ere you were born was beauty's summer

to praise.', '  and thou in this shalt find thy monument,', \"  when tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.\", '  finding the first conceit of love there bred,', '  where time and outward form would show it dead.', '  for nothing this wide universe i call,', '  save thou my rose, in it thou art my all.', '  then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,', '  even to thy pure and most most loving breast.', '  pity me then dear friend, and i assure ye,', '  even that your pity is enough to cure me.', '  you are so strongly in my purpose bred,', '  that all the world besides methinks are dead.', '  incapable of more, replete with you,', '  my most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.', \"  if it be poisoned, 'tis the lesser sin,\", '  that mine eye loves it and doth first begin.', '  love is a babe, then might i not say so', '  to give full growth to that which still doth grow.', '  if this be error and upon me proved,', '  i never writ, nor no man ever loved.', '  since my appeal says i did strive to prove', '  the constancy and virtue of your love.', '  but thence i learn and find the lesson true,', '  drugs poison him that so feil sick of you.', '  so i return rebuked to my content,', '  and gain by ills thrice more than i have spent.', '  but that your trespass now becomes a fee,', '  mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.', '  unless this general evil they maintain,', '  all men are bad and in their badness reign.', '  to keep an adjunct to remember thee', '  were to import forgetfulness in me.', '  this i do vow and this shall ever be,', '  i will be true despite thy scythe and thee.', '  to this i witness call the fools of time,', '  which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.', '  hence, thou suborned informer, a true soul', '  when most impeached, stands least in thy control.', '  her audit (though delayed) answered must be,', '  and her quietus is to render thee.', '  yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,', '  that every tongue says beauty should look so.', '  since saucy jacks so happy are in this,', '  give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.', '  all this the world well knows yet none knows well,', '  to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.', '  and yet by heaven i think my love as rare,', '  as any she belied with false compare.', '  in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,', '  and thence this slander as i think proceeds.', '  then will i swear beauty herself is black,', '  and all they foul that thy complexion lack.', '  and yet thou wilt, for i being pent in thee,', '  perforce am thine and all that is in me.', '  him have i lost, thou hast both him and me,', '  he pays the whole, and yet am i not free.', '  let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill,', \"  think all but one, and me in that one 'will.'\", '  make but my name thy love, and love that still,', \"  and then thou lov'st me for my name is will.\", '  in things right true my heart and eyes have erred,', '  and to this false plague are they now transferred.', '  therefore i lie with her, and she with me,', '  and in our faults by lies we flattered be.', '  yet do not so, but since i am near slain,', '  kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.', '  that i may not be so, nor thou belied,', '  bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.', '  only my plague thus far i count my gain,', '  that she that makes me sin, awards me pain.', '  if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,', '  by self-example mayst thou be denied.', '  so will i pray that thou mayst have thy will,', '  if thou turn back and my loud crying still.', \"  yet this shall i ne'er know but live in doubt,\", '  till my bad angel fire my good one out.', \"  'i hate', from hate away she threw,\", \"  and saved my life saying 'not you'.\", '  so shall thou feed on death, that feeds on men,', \"  and death once dead, there's no more dying then.\", '  for i have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,', '  who
